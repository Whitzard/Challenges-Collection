题目：brainfxxker's revenge

题目描述：

Once upon a time... there was once a king, brainfxxker, but he was blown up by some bad guys :( "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!", a rough but powerful voice came by. Who is he? No one knows. The only thing we know is that he came from Shinnippori. "Like embarrassing me huh!? that's not right, man." he said, as if brainfxxker was still alive. "You got me mad now", he decided to be his successor, the New King.
