### Vera
Description
For some reason, big hacker w1nd has been arrested by us. During the search on his computer, we found a strange file that could not be opened. Someone guessed that it had been encrypted, but W1nd refused to provide the password. Near the computer, we also found a book with a bookmark. Specifically, the bookmark is on page 13 of this book. Maybe this is the length of the password.
