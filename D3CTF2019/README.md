### disappeared_memory
Description
My name is Jim Shown. Ten years ago, I was a Master of Windows, and now I'm a great great great OZone pentester. Accidentally, I got this dump file in some ways. It's said that this memory dump contains a secret. After analysis, I found a suspicious process, ...but something went wrong. I have never encountered this kind of problem ten years ago, that must be something new of Windows 10 ;(

P.S. Jim Shown and OZone are just fake names ;)
hint1: Find compressed memory!

### Bivariate
Description
The Coppersmith method, proposed by Don Coppersmith in the Wild, is a method to find small integer zeroes of univariate or bivariate polynomials modulo a given integer. The method uses the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm (LLL) to find a polynomial that has the same zeroes as the target polynomial but smaller coefficients.
